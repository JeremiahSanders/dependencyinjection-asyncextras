# ServiceCollectionExtensions.TryAddAsyncResolver&lt;T&gt; method

Adds a ServiceDescriptor for an [`IAsyncResolver`](../IAsyncResolver-1.md) of *T* if that type has not been registered.

```csharp
public static IServiceCollection TryAddAsyncResolver<T>(this IServiceCollection serviceCollection, 
    Func<IServiceProvider, Task<T>> asyncFactory, 
    ServiceLifetime lifetime = ServiceLifetime.Transient)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T |  |
| serviceCollection |  |
| asyncFactory |  |
| lifetime |  |

## Remarks

When requiring this async dependency (*T*) via constructor parameters, make sure to use an [`IAsyncResolver`](../IAsyncResolver-1.md) of *T*.

This registration does not enable *T* to be resolved from IServiceProvider instances created from this IServiceCollection.

Alternately, use the [`GetServiceAsync`](../ServiceProviderAsyncExtensions/GetServiceAsync.md) and [`GetRequiredServiceAsync`](../ServiceProviderAsyncExtensions/GetRequiredServiceAsync.md) methods to access *T* (from any IServiceProvider instances created from this IServiceCollection).
