# IAsyncResolver&lt;T&gt; interface

A provider of asynchronous *T* values.

```csharp
public interface IAsyncResolver<T>
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | A type which is resolved asynchronously. |

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetValueAsync](IAsyncResolver-1/GetValueAsync.md)(…) | Get the asynchronous *T*. |

## Remarks

This type is intended for use with a IServiceProvider. Specifically, it is meant to address resolving dependency injection services which must be accessed asynchronously. E.g., a configuration object which must be requested from a network source.
